	abstract = {The objectives of this tutorial are to introduce the most important concepts and define some of the common terms involved in laser beam quality; to review briefly some of the beam quality definitions and measurement schemes employed to date; to describe some of the problems associated with various approaches and with standardization efforts for beam quality measurement; and finally to express a few of the author’s personal prejuduces on this subject. The "Maybe" in the title of this tutorial is intended to convey that measuring, or even rigorously defining, any single all-inclusive measure of laser beam quality is still a controversial an unsettled topic—and may remain so for some time.},

A switching from negative nonlinear absorption (saturated absorption) to positive nonlinear absorption (two photon absorption) has been observed as the input laser irradiance increases from 0.049GW/cm2 to 0.106GW/cm2. The nonlinear absorption coefficient increases monotonically with the increase of pulse duration from 65ps to 4ns.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we are dedicated to exemplifying a two parameter curve fitting method and developing a Matlab-based simulation program to extract the nonlinear refractive index and nonlinear absorption coefficient from closed-aperture Z-scan or R(z) data without the need for performing open-aperture Z-scan measurement. It should be noted, however, that both approaches can only be applicable to a case for which the on-axis phase shift at the focus is small. In this way, we not only determine the nonlinear parameters quickly with reasonable accuracy, as well as save time, efforts and equipment in the process of Z-scan implementation, but also obtain an initial estimate in order to compare with the results of the open-aperture Z-scan measurement when needed.},

	abstract = {A sensitive single-beam technique for measuring both the nonlinear refractive index and nonlinear absorption coefficient for a wide variety of materials is reported. The authors describe the experimental details and present a comprehensive theoretical analysis including cases where nonlinear refraction is accompanied by nonlinear absorption. In these experiments, the transmittance of a sample is measured through a finite aperture in the far field as the sample is moved along the propagation path (z) of a focused Gaussian beam. The sign and magnitude of the nonlinear refraction are easily deduced from such a transmittance curve (Z-scan). Employing this technique, a sensitivity of better than lambda /300 wavefront distortion is achieved in n/sub 2/ measurements of {BaF}/sub 2/ using picosecond frequency-doubled Nd:{YAG} laser pulses.{\textless}{\textgreater}},
